## Pomidori Native Electron app

### What is pomidori?

Pomidori is a productivity application that has a USB device attached to it.

The purpose of this application is to give an external indication on whether you are focused on a task or available for interruptions.

Engineering is hard and requires dedicated focus on tasks, when you have the indicator on, the goal is that other engineers will respect that and will not interrupt.

The app works in conjunction with the [Server app](https://github.com/fullstack-network/pomidori-server), which is also open source.

The server will save a history of tasks you've been working on.

### LED

There are a couple of options that will come with this software. One will be a cube based LED array and one will be a strip based array.

Whether you choose one or the other, there will be progress indicated on the USB as well. So, just by looking at your LED, people will know whether you just started your task or well on your way to finish.
